# Why do we want to use ROS
Robots are becoming more and more complicated. In our Melson community we have some people which prefer to work with hardware
and some which would like to work with only vision algorythms. We're are also thought different programming languages. But we still want to work with each other. ROS enables us to reach such a goal.
We can write our code in C++, Python, Java, Matlab or other programming language which is supported by ROS.
Due to the fact that we're working with this magnificent "framework" we can communicate via ROS messages, services and actions even though we're using different programming
languages. 

Let's say that we want our robot to play footbal match. This problem is so complicated that writing everything without ROS may be a nightmare.
But what ROS really gives us?
- Better code clarity for example using rqt we may see nodes connections or monitor parameters which are sent on a topic
- Ease of rebuilding/developing code
- Writting in different languages
- Multiple packages and ROS community
- Simulations such as Gazebo or Webots
