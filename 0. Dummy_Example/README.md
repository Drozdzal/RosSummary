# I am big fan of oranges however didnt have one so I've used carrot instead. I've decided to create magnificient example.

This is Number 0 of ros_tutorial shows usage of ROS. Code is definetely not perfect, creating whole "project" took something like:
2h. It's just created to show usefullnes of Robotic Operating system. Needed items:
- Computer
- Tello drone
- Carrot
- blue roller

Whole project contains all types of ROS messages. It shows that if we once create move service or command service
which connect software with hardware then it is easy to use it in different usages
